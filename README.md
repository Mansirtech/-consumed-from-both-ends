# Satellite Investigations of Deforestation and Desertification in Nigeria

This repository contains the methodology, data, and GEE code for multiple remote sensing investigations into environmental change in Nigeria, conducted for an investigative news report.

## Projects

This repository is organized into three main projects:

1. **[Cross River: Cocoa & Deforestation](cross_river_cocoa\README.md)**: An analysis of forest conversion for agriculture in the Cross River National Park.
2. **[Gashaka-Gumti: Logging & Habitat Loss](gashaka_gumti_logging/README.md)**: An investigation into a large-scale logging boom and its impact on land cover and wildlife habitat.
3. **[Sahel: Desertification & The Great Green Wall](sahel_desertification)**: A summary of analyses on groundwater changes and vegetation growth along the Great Green Wall.
