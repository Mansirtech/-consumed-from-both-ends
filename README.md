# Project 3: Desertification and the Great Green Wall

## Investigative Focus
To analyze large-scale environmental trends related to desertification across the Sahel, focusing on groundwater storage and the impact of the Great Green Wall initiative.

## Methodology
This investigation utilized two distinct analytical methods based on different satellite missions and data sources. Unlike the other projects, these analyses did not involve custom GEE scripts but were based on interpreting and cross-referencing existing scientific data products and open-source intelligence.

- **[Groundwater Analysis](./methodology_text/grace_groundwater_analysis.md)**: Details the use of NASA's GRACE satellite data to track changes in underground water storage.
- **[Great Green Wall Tree Count](./methodology_text/ggw_tree_count_analysis.md)**: Explains the grid-based analysis using an 18x18 km grid, ArcGIS image classification, and NDVI to extract land cover and land use patterns, plus a sub-methodology for on-site verification regarding insurgency-related abandonment and green wall interventions.

## Data Sources

* **Groundwater:** Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) Satellite Data (NASA)
* **Vegetation/Tree Count:** High-Resolution Satellite Mosaics (e.g., Maxar, Planet)
* **Context:** Open-source intelligence on conflict, displacement, and project implementation sites.
