## 2. World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA)

- **Publication and Updates:** WDPA is maintained and regularly updated by UNEP-WCMC. It is continuously updated with new data, ensuring current reflections of protected areas globally.

- **Purpose:** To provide comprehensive, publicly available information about terrestrial, marine, and inland water protected areas worldwide.

- **Brief History:** The WDPA has evolved as a vital tool for conservation planning and monitoring since its inception in the 1990s. It aggregates data from national authorities and international organizations.

- **Applications and Uses:** 
  - Mapping and assessing protected areas
  - Supporting biodiversity conservation initiatives
  - Policy-making and land management

- **Relevance to This Project:** WDPA data is crucial for demarcating the boundaries of national parks in Nigeria, such as Cross River and Gashaka-Gumti, providing spatial boundaries necessary for our deforestation and logging analyses.

## 3. NASA’s GRACE Mission

- **Mission Period:** 2002–2017

- **Purpose:** To monitor changes in Earth’s gravity field, which are used to infer variations in underground water storage among other mass changes.

- **Brief History:** The GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) mission was launched by NASA in 2002 and provided unprecedented insights into the movement of water on and beneath the Earth’s surface until its mission ended in 2017. Its successor, GRACE Follow-On, continues this vital work.

- **Applications and Uses:** 
  - Hydrological studies
  - Monitoring of groundwater depletion and recharge
  - Climate change research

- **Relevance to This Project:** GRACE data helps in understanding the dynamics of groundwater storage in the Sahel region. The insights from GRACE are used to analyze water stress and its interplay with desertification processes in Nigeria.

## 4. High-Resolution Satellite Imagery (e.g., Maxar, Planet)

- **Publication and Availability:** These commercial sources provide near-real-time high-resolution imagery and have been available during the last decade.

- **Purpose:** To capture detailed imagery that allows for the analysis of fine-scale features, particularly useful for local land cover and land use mapping.

- **Brief History:** With the rapid advancement in satellite technology, companies like Maxar and Planet have emerged as key providers of high-resolution imagery that complement government data in both spatial and temporal aspects.

- **Applications and Uses:** 
  - Detailed land cover classification
  - Urban and rural planning
  - Environmental monitoring and change detection

- **Relevance to This Project:** High-resolution imagery is used for the extraction of local land use data, especially in the analysis of tree cover, agricultural practices, and the socio-economic factors affecting deforestation and desertification.

## 5. Open-Source Intelligence and Local Data

- **Purpose:** To integrate ground-truth information and socio-political context into the satellite data analysis.

- **Brief History:** With the advent of digital communication and mobile technology, open-source intelligence (OSINT) has become a powerful tool for gathering real-time data about socio-political events, such as insurgency and areas of abandonment.

- **Applications and Uses:** 
  - Verification of satellite data
  - Correlating environmental changes with human activities
  - Enhancing the credibility of remote sensing analyses

- **Relevance to This Project:** OSINT provides a critical layer of context by corroborating satellite findings with on-the-ground realities, particularly in identifying regions affected by insurgency, abandonment, and past green wall initiatives. This integrated approach strengthens the overall analysis by connecting socio-political factors with environmental changes.

## 6. MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)

- **Mission Period:**
  - Terra: Launched in 1999
  - Aqua: Launched in 2002

- **Purpose:** Provides high temporal resolution data for monitoring vegetation dynamics, land surface temperature, and atmospheric conditions.

- **Brief History:** The MODIS instruments have been essential for providing near-daily observations of the Earth's surface, thereby supporting climate, vegetation, and environmental research on a global scale.

- **Applications and Uses:**
  - Generating NDVI time-series to monitor vegetation health
  - Assessing deforestation, drought, and fire events
  - Evaluating land surface temperature and albedo properties

- **Relevance to This Project:** MODIS data, with its frequent revisit time and moderate resolution, complements high-resolution imagery by offering temporal context for monitoring large-scale environmental changes such as deforestation and desertification in Nigeria.

## 7. Sentinel Missions (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2)

- **Mission Period:** 
  - Sentinel-1: Launched in 2014
  - Sentinel-2: Launched in 2015

- **Purpose:** Sentinel-1 provides radar imagery for all-weather observations, while Sentinel-2 offers high-resolution optical data for detailed land monitoring.

- **Brief History:** As key components of the European Copernicus Programme, the Sentinel missions deliver free and open access Earth observation data that have transformed environmental monitoring and disaster management practices.

- **Applications and Uses:** 
  - Tracking land cover changes and surface dynamics
  - Supporting agriculture, forestry, and urban planning
  - Enhancing environmental analyses through the integration of optical and radar data

- **Relevance to This Project:** Data from Sentinel missions augments other satellite datasets by enhancing the spatial and temporal resolution of deforestation and desertification analyses in Nigeria, providing robust, multi-sensor insights to support informed decision-making.
