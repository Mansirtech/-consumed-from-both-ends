### Great Green Wall Tree Count Methodology

For this analysis, an 18x18 km grid was constructed over the Great Green Wall corridor using high-resolution satellite imagery. Manageable grid samples were extracted from the years 2007 and 2025, capturing distinct snapshots of the region's land cover.

Image classification was performed in ArcGIS, complemented by NDVI analysis. This dual approach enabled the extraction of both land cover data and the creation of detailed land use maps for village sites within the corridor. One key insight from this analysis was the "legacy effect," where vegetation was observed in areas abandoned long ago, likely as a result of insurgency-driven depopulation.

#### Sub-methodology: On-site Verification and Corroboration

To strengthen the satellite-based findings, on-site techniques were integrated into the study. These included:

- **Field Surveys:** Conducted to observe tangible signs of insurgency presence and to confirm areas of abandonment.
- **Historical Data Collection:** Gathering records of past green wall tree planting initiatives over the last two decades, enabling a temporal comparison with satellite imagery.
- **Local Intelligence:** Incorporating geotagged reports and community feedback to identify regions with insurgency activity versus areas that experienced abandonment and subsequent regrowth.

This combined methodology allowed us to correlate land cover changes with socio-political events, providing a comprehensive view of environmental and human dynamics along the Great Green Wall.
